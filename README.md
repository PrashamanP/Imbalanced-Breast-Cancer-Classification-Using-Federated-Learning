# Imbalanced-Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning

## ABSTRACT

Accurate breast cancer detection using automated algorithms remains a significant challenge in the literature. Despite numerous attempts to address this issue, an exact solution is yet to be found. The problem is exacerbated by imbalanced datasets, where the number of instances of a particular class far exceeds that of others. This paper proposes a framework based on transfer learning to address these challenges, focusing on histopathological and imbalanced image classification. The EfficientNet-B0 serves as the base model, enhanced with state-of-the-art techniques to improve overall system performance. Utilizing the ImageNet dataset as the source domain, the learned knowledge is applied to the target domain of histopathological images. Experimentation on a large-scale dataset of 277,524 images demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to existing literature. Numerical simulations on a supercomputer provide guidelines for transfer learning and imbalanced image classification.

## INTRODUCTION

The challenge of accurately detecting breast cancer using automated algorithms persists in the literature, exacerbated by imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces a transfer learning-based framework to address the complexities of breast cancer detection, specifically focusing on histopathological images with imbalanced class distribution.

The approach leverages EfficientNet-B0 as the foundational model, enhancing its performance through cutting-edge techniques. Transfer learning principles are embraced, applying knowledge gained from the ImageNet dataset (as the source domain) to the target domain comprising histopathological images. Extensive experimentation on a dataset of 277,524 images demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to existing methodologies in the literature.

Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, ranking as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. Despite advancements in cancer theragnostic approaches, particularly for the Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) subtype, breast cancer remains a formidable challenge. This project builds upon the proposed solution, employing the transfer learning paradigm to classify histopathological images.
